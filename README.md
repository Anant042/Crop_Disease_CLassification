## Potato Disease Classification using CNN

### Overview
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify potato leaves into three categories:  
- **Early Blight**  
- **Late Blight**  
- **Healthy**

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadardiputra/potato-leaf-disease-dataset](### Dataset)
The dataset consists of images of potato leaves affected by:  
* Early Blight  
* Late Blight  
* Healthy leaves

### Model Architecture
The model is built using a CNN with the following layers:  
- Convolutional Layers  
- Max Pooling Layers  
- Fully Connected Layers  
- Softmax Activation for Classification
